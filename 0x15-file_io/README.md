0x15. C - File I/O
Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
Task 2
Create a function that creates a file.

Prototype: int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);
where filename is the name of the file to create and text_content is a NULL terminated string to write to the file
Returns: 1 on success, -1 on failure (file can not be created, file can not be written, write “fails”, etc…)
The created file must have those permissions: rw-------. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions.
if the file already exists, truncate it
if filename is NULL return -1
if text_content is NULL create an empty file
